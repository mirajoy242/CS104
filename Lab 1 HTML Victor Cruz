                    Hi, my name is Victor Cruz. I am a first year architecture student currently pursuing my bachelors. I was born and raised in Woodbridge, NJ and I'm the middle child in a family of 5 (not including the 2 dogs we have). I am usually quiet and stolid even with some of my friends. I enjoy gaming with friends and spending time in nature. I want to achieve my Master's in Architecture after my Bachelors.
