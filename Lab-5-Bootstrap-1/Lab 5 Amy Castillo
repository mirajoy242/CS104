                    Hi! My Name is Amy Castillo, and I was born and raised in North Jersey.<br>I grew up in Union City, at the park, and spent most of my childhood there.<br>However, I ended up moving to Florida for 3 years with my mom, and when I moved back to Jersey my mom stayed in Florida.<br>I am 18 years old and a freshman at NJIT, studying Architecture.<br>I plan to get my Bachelor in Architecture with a minor in Construction or Engineering, or maybe even completely changing my major to one of those.

                            And it payed off because the team I was on ended up winning our county championship game. It felt so rewarding.

                    I've been watching women's college volleyball for the past almost two years. Nebraska became my favorite team this year, <br>
                    In the past years it has been the Texas team, but a lot of the players that I liked left, and this year Nebraska has <br>
                    great players. Something that I find interesting about their team is that none of their players are seniors, so <br>
                    that means they're going to have the exact same team for next years season. And they just beat the number one team in <br>
                    the nation, so now that means they're number one. So, I'm excited to see what they will accomplish this season <br>
                    and next.
